Hi! I’m loveLaceLogic — a computer science student at Louisiana State University of Alexandria passionate about solving problems through code and creating efficient, elegant solutions. Inspired by Ada Lovelace, the world’s first computer programmer, I believe in the power of logic, creativity, and innovation.

My tech journey has been driven by curiosity and a love for complex mathematical structures and well-crafted code. As I continue to grow my skills, I’m building a portfolio of projects that showcase my knowledge and dedication — from algorithms and data structures to web development and software design.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me balancing life as a full-time student, working professional, and parent while chasing big dreams and bigger challenges.

Let’s connect, collaborate, and create something incredible. 💻✨
